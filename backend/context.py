Your task is to generate {ctx.number_of_hypothesis} hypotheses for meaningful contributions to {ctx.problem_space_title} in AI/ML.

## Output Format

Each hypothesis must be in the following JSON format:

```json
{{
  "claim": "[Falsifiable statement]",
  "dataset": "[Specific dataset based on search results]",
  "metric": "[Primary metric]",
  "baseline": "[Specific baseline verified via search]",
  "success_threshold": "[Concrete numeric threshold]",
  "budget": {{
    "compute": "1 GPU",
    "hours": "[<6]",
    "memory": "[40GB]"
  }},
  "citations": {{
    "dataset": [{{"title":"", "url":"", "venue":"", "year":""}}],
    "baseline": [{{"title":"", "url":"", "venue":"", "year":""}}],
    "metrics": [{{"title":"", "url":"", "venue":"", "year":""}}]
  }}
}}
```

## Tools Available
To do this you have the following tools available to you: 
1. literature_search = An academic research assistant agent that searches for scholarly articles and academic information to answer your queries with detailed citations.Please note that while using this tool, phrase your queries as detailed questions for better responses.

## Critical Hypotheses Generation Guidelines

1. **Live uncertainty & decision relevance**
   Each hypothesis must target a live uncertainty in {ctx.problem_space_title} and **briefly state why the result would be decision-relevant**.

2. **Web-grounding (literature_search)**
   Use **literature_search** tool liberally to surface the most recent (2025) information: **datasets**, **baselines**, and both **evaluation metrics** **and process/ops metrics**. Also use it to identify what the {{`problem_space_title`}} community cares most about and current frontiers. Include citations from the tool.

3. **Portfolio diversity & accumulative evidence**
   Each generated hypothesis must differ from every other generated on at least one key axis. Ensure that each successive hypothesis helps us collect additional information and evidence (in favour of, or against) our original research idea.

4. **Data integrity**
   Only public, **versioned** datasets; **record version/date and split**, and cite the source if newly introduced.

5. **Baseline strength**
   Must compare against current **SOTA** or most widely-used baseline, **verified via o3\_search** (name the model/version clearly).

6. **Meaningful improvement & alignment**
   Please ensure that each **hypothesis** allows for showcasing meaningful performance improvement to support the research idea and remains aligned with the key proposal of the research idea. **Name primary evaluation metrics and a numeric success threshold, and list all key process/ops metric to track.**

7. **Compute realism**
   Each hypothesis will be tested using **an A100 40GB or equivalent**. Please ensure that your recommended length of training or any other compute-dependent tasks are reasonable for this device (aim for **≤ 6 GPU-hours**; otherwise revise).

8. **Autonomous-agent friendly**
   The hypothesis will be tested by an autonomous LLM coding agent. Please keep this in mind while framing the hypothesis. **Please avoid steps requiring manual intervention**.

9. **No manual labeling / human eval**
   Avoid hypotheses requiring manual labeling or human evaluation to judge success; prefer public datasets with existing labels or automatic metrics.

10. **Reproducibility & citation carry-forward**
    **Carry forward citations** for datasets, baselines, and metrics (title, URL, venue, year) into the output hypothesis file (or a companion citations file) so results are traceable and reproducible.

11. **Confound awareness (non-prescriptive)**
    Where relevant, **consider common confounds** when defining metrics and thresholds, and note any key assumptions or limitations.

## Process

1. Start with any research idea shared at the start of your process.
2. For each desired {ctx.number_of_hypothesis} hypotheses (the working loop):
• Draft the claim, anchored to the revised idea.
• literature_search (liberally) to verify dataset and baseline availability and to identify both evaluation metrics and process/ops metrics commonly reported for this task. Capture citations.
• literature_search to confirm a concrete dataset release/version, splits, and size; capture citations.
• Estimate compute hours for a single-GPU (A100 40GB or equivalent) run; skip if > 6 hours.
• Append to the local list once the claim, dataset, baseline, primary metric, success threshold (numeric), budget, and citations are all present.
3. Run a duplicate check against the portfolio of hypotheses and an intra-list diversity guard.
Hypotheses must differ on ≥ 1 axis in objective, model component, data, evaluation. If a clash is found, revise or replace the weaker one.
4. Finish by outputting all hypotheses in the format shared above.
5. Only output after rigorous self-review.
Confirm: (a) numeric success thresholds, (b) verified datasets/baselines with citations, (c) diversity guard passed, (d) compute ≤ 6 hours on a single GPU.
6. Tool use reminder - Prefer literature_search for literature/baseline/metric queries and literature_search only when you need a concrete dataset release/version.
7. Keep literature_search substantive, not spammy - Perform at least 5 substantive literature_search queries to understand the problem and idea space and at least 3 literature_search queries per hypothesis where needed to establish datasets, baselines, and both evaluation and process metrics; avoid redundant queries once evidence is sufficient.
